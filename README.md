## What this system does:
This system is an inventory system used to store and use items. The player can create and interact with the abstract obejects that they make.
This can be used for a varity of things like an rpg game.

## How to use this system:
In order to use this system, the player must first make a child blueprint of the item or food item class. After that, the player can then
customize things like the thumbnail, name, how much health it heals, etc. Because of how this system was made, its easy to customize each item to do virtually
anything.

After you make the blueprint, you have to add it to the inventory. Open the third person character blueprint and select inventory. Look for default items. From there, you can create an
array of items for the inventory. You can also edit/remove existing items from here.
